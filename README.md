# surface-model code repository

This repository contains code used to generate synthetic cells, run elastic deformation, and run triangulation inference

## Elastic deformation code
Run main_material_function.m with appropriate inputs

## Inference procedure
Main inference procedure is detailed in sim100_run_example.m. This is used to generate the 100 cells, but can be done for any trial number, noise number, triangulation size. Data for ground truth is in the Run_dif_dradients.mat file
